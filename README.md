# Coroutines Coding Challenge

Create a new Android Project, add coroutines dependencies to the gradle and write codes to launch two coroutins. One coroutine should launch in the main thread and the other one should 
launch in a background thread. Also, inside each coroutine, log a message, which shows the name of the thread.
